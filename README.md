# subee_mp3
Set of scripts for transferring music in right order, single volume, etc. from an m3u8 playlist to sdcards/usbs for use in Subaru cars with Hamman/Kardon audios.

For now it's just a simple script, we'll see where we go from here - if you want to collaborate, write me a message. :)

## Dependencies

Subee_mp3 will need the following dependencies:
 * ffmpeg with mp3 codec (and any decoders you like)
 * mp3gain

## cp_audio.sh

Usage:
    bash /path/to/subee_mp3/cp_audio.sh <your_playlist>.m3u8 

# Future plans

Lots of!
